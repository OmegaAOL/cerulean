# Cerulean Client

This is the repository for the in-alpha Cerulean Bluesky Client. It is written in C# and uses the .NET Framework 2. This enables the\n
executable, without any dependencies, torun on Windows 98. To interface with the Bluesky API it uses curl-OpenSSL, which I have 
gotten to ![run on Windows 98 First Edition and above.](https://github.com/OmegaAOL/curl-windows98).
